### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anthony Choo, an aspiring data analyst with a background in Engineering! From my 4+ years of engineering, I have incorporated ETL through SQL, transformations by Power Query or VBA, and dashboard visualizations through Power BI or Tableau. 

With prior experience focused primarily on manufacturing, I'm hoping to transition my critical thinking skills over to Business Intelligence and further demonstrate how visualizations are key to delivering succinct conslusions with data-driven evidence.

Currently, I'm open to remote opportunites in roles such as BI Analyst, Data Analyst, or Associate Data Scientist.
